.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
This utility sends a MODE SENSE SCSI command (the 10 byte variant
by default) to the given device and then outputs the response. There
is no facility to change the page or descriptor data with this utility.
If no page is given (and '-l' is not selected) then '-a' is assumed.
.TP
-a
output all the mode pages supported by the given device.
.TP
-A
output all the mode pages and subpages supported by the device.
.TP
-c=page_control
up to four different versions of each page are held by the device:
the current values [0] (i.e. those active at the moment), the changeable
values [1] (bit mask showing which sections could be changed with a MODE
SELECT), default values [2] (the manufacturer's settings) and saved
values [3] (the values that will be re-instated the next time the device
is power cycled). If this option is not given then current values [0]
are assumed.
.TP
-d
disable block descriptors. By default, block descriptors (usually one or
none) are returned in a MODE SENSE response. This option sets the "disable
block descriptors" (DBD) bit in the cdb which instructs the device not
to return any block descriptors in its response. Older devices may not
support this setting and should return an "illegal request" status;
alternatively they may ignore it.
.TP
-D
disable outputting block descriptors. Irrespective of whether block
descriptors are present in the response or not, they are not output.
.TP
-h
currently only suppresses the printing out of known page code descriptions
.TP
-l
lists all common page and subpage codes and their names that are found in
the command set that matches the peripheral type of the given device.
If no device and no page_code is given then the common page and
subpage codes and their names for the disk command set are listed.
If no device is given and a page_code is given then the common page and
subpage codes and their names for the command set whose peripheral device
type matches the value given to page_code are listed. For
example 'sg_mode -l -p=1' lists the command mode pages and subpages for tape
devices. Additionally if a sub_page_code is given then it is interpreted as
a transport identifier and command transport specific mode page codes and
their names are listed following the main mode page list.
Other options are ignored.
.TP
-p=<page_code>
page code to fetch. Should be a hexadecimal number between 0 and 3f
inclusive (0 to 63 decimal). The default value is 0.
.TP
-p=<page_code>,<sub_page_code>
page code and subpage code values to fetch. The page code should be a
hexadecimal number between 0 and 3f inclusive. The subpage code should
be a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff inclusive. The default value
of both is 0.
.TP
-r
output the selected mode page to stdout a byte per line. Each line contains
two hexadecimal digits (e.g. "0a"). Useful as input (after editing) to
the sg_wr_mode utility.
.TP
-subp=<sub_page_code>
sub page code to fetch. Should be a hexadecimal number between 0 and 
0xff inclusive. The default value is 0.
.TP
-v
verbose: output cdbs in hex before executing them.
.TP
-V
print out version string
.TP
-6
by default this utility sends out a 10 byte MODE SENSE command. However
some SCSI devices only support 6 byte MODE SENSE commands (e.g. SCSI-2
tape drives). This parameter forces the use of 6 byte MODE SENSE commands.
.TP
-?
output usage message. Ignore all other parameters.
.PP
If the normal sg_modes utility fails with "illegal command
operation code" then try the "-6" parameter. To alter page settings
see the program listed in the "See Also" section below.
.PP
Mode pages cannot be modified with this utility. Mode pages (and subpages)
can be modified with the sg_wr_mode and sginfo utilities in the sg3_utils
package. Some other utilities for displaying and modifying mode pages are
listed in the "see also" section below.
.PP
This utility performs a SCSI INQUIRY command to determine the peripheral
type of the device (e.g. 0 -> Direct Access Device (disk)) prior to
sending a MODE SENSE command. This helps in decoding the block
descriptor and mode pages.
.PP
In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the given device must be
a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. disks
and SCSI DVDs) can also be specified. For example "sg_modes -a /dev/sda"
will work in the 2.6 series kernels.
