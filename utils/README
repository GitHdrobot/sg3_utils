This directory contains these utilities:
  - hxascdmp: takes a binary stream and converts it to hexadecimal ASCII
    which is sent to stdout. The incoming binary stream can either be
    from a file or, in the absence of a file name, from stdin. Similar to
    the Unix "od" command. By default, it decodes 16 bytes per line with
    an ASCII interpretation to the right of each line.
  - sg_chk_asc: utility decodes the SCSI additional sense code table
    found at http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.txt and checks it
    against the table found in sg_lib.c in the lib/ subdirectory.
    It is designed to keep the table in sg_lib.c in "sync" with the
    table at the t10.org web site.


These utilities can be built for Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris.
The hxascdmp utility can also be built in a Windows MinGW/MSYS environment.
This command should be sufficient: 'make hxascdmp' .

To build sg_chk_asc the sg_lib.o file must be present (i.e. compiled) in
the lib/ subdirectory. One way to meet that requirement is to execute
'./configure' in the main directory then 'cd lib ; make '.
