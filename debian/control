Description: Collection of Linux utilities for devices that use the
 SCSI command set. See the README, CHANGELOG and COVERAGE files.
 .
 Requires the linux kernel 2.4 series or later. In the 2.4 series
 SCSI generic device names (e.g. /dev/sg0) must be used. In the 2.6
 series other device names may be used as well (e.g. /dev/sda).
 .
 The package includes:
     * sg_dd - a variant of 'dd' that works at the SCSI command level
     * sg_emc_trespass - vendor specific for Clariion hardware
     * sg_format - format SCSI disks
     * sg_get_config - get features and profiles of MMC devices
     * sg_ident - report and set device identifiers
     * sginfo - a re-porting of the 'scsiinfo' program, updated
     * sg_inq - a utility for poking around with the SCSI INQUIRY command
     * sg_logs - prints out log sense pages
     * sg_luns - prints out REPORT LUNS response
     * sg_map - shows the mapping between SCSI devices and sg devices
     * sgm_dd - like sg_dd, but uses mmap()'d IO
     * sg_modes - prints out mode sense pages
     * sg_opcodes - reports supported opcodes and task management fcns
     * sgp_dd - like sg_dd, only multithreaded
     * sg_persist - accesses the Persistent Reservation In and Out commands
     * sg_prevent - issues PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command (MMC + SSC)
     * sg_rbuf - tests SCSI bus speed
     * sg_read - reads multiple blocks, useful for timing
     * sg_read_long - read a "long" block from the given device
     * sg_readcap - prints the output of a READ CAPACITY command
     * sg_reassign - issues a REASSIGN BLOCKS command (map out bad sectors)
     * sg_requests - issues a REQUEST SENSE command (event polling)
     * sg_reset - exercises SCSI device/bus/host reset capability
     * sg_rmsn - READ SERIAL SERIAL NUMBER
     * sg_rtpg - REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS
     * sg_scan - displays the SCSI bus on stdout
     * sg_senddiag - runs SCSI self tests
     * sg_ses - fetches status and send control to a SES device
     * sg_start - spins up (or down) disks and cd/dvds
     * sg_sync - issues a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command
     * sg_test_rwbuf - tests the SCSI host adapter
     * sg_turs - execute a TEST UNIT READY command on the given device
     * sg_verify - issues VERIFY command on SCSI disks
     * sg_write_long - write a "long" block to the given device
     * sg_wr_mode - low level utility to change mode pages
 .
 It also includes source code for some example programs that demonstrate
 how to use the scsi generic driver.
