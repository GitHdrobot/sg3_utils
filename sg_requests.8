.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send REQUEST SENSE command to a Linux SCSI device and output the response
which is expected to be in sense data format. Both fixed and descriptor
format are supported.
.TP
--desc | -d
sets the 'DESC' bit in the REQUEST SENSE SCSI command. The given device
should return sense data in descriptor (rather than fixed) format. This
will only occur if the given device recognizes descriptor format (SPC-3
and later). If the device is pre SPC-3 then setting a bit in a reserved
field may cause a check condition status with an illegal request sense key.
.TP
--help | -h
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
--verbose | -v
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
--version | -V
print the version string and then exit.
.PP
Some time ago the REQUEST SENSE command was very important for error
and warning processing in SCSI. The autosense capability rendered this
command almost superfluous. However recent SCSI drafts (e.g. SBC-2 rev
16) increase the utility of the REQUEST SENSE command. Idle and standby
power conditions can now be detected with this command. Interestingly
the sense key is set to "no sense" while the asc/ascq code convey the
information (e.g. 0x5e/0x4 "Standby condition activated by command").
