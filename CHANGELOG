Each utility has its own version number, date of last changes and
some description at the top of its ".c" file. "KG" indicates work by
Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de>.

Changelog for sg3_utils-0.90
----------------------------
  - switch from dated versioning. Previous version was sg3_utils001012.
    Arbitrarily start at package version 0.90 . Start Changelog.
  - incorporate KG's patches from Suse scsi.spm source rpm compilation:
    - add KG's sg_test_rwbuf utility to read and write to disk buffer
    - clean up Makefile to include a "make install" (and also add a
      "make uninstall").
    - add "-uno" switch to sginfo
  - make raw and sg devices equally acceptable to sg_dd and sgp_dd.
    [Raw devices still not as fast as sg devices doing disk to disk
    copies in sgp_dd but this may be improved soon. Still faster than
    using dd!]
  - change lseek() in sg_dd and sgp_dd to _llseek() [using code borrowed
    from fdisk] so big disks can be properly offset with 'skip' and
    'seek' arguments. [This change is significant for raw devices and
    normal files since sg devices already use 31 bit block addressing.]
  - rename sg_s3_inq to sg_inq. This utility allows the INQUIRY response
    to be decoded as per SCSI 3 and 4. Also can probe EVPD and CmdDt pages.
  - change multiplier suffixes on sg_dd, sgp_dd and sg_turs so lower case
    "k, m, g" are powers of 2 while "K, M, G" are powers of 10. This idea
    borrowed from lmdd (lmbench suite)
  - retire a few more less used utilities into the archive directory.
  - add man pages for sg_dd, sgp_dd and sg_map
