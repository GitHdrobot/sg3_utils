.SH NAME
sg_map \- displays mapping between sg and other SCSI devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sg_map
[\fI-a\fR] [\fI-h\fR] [\fI-i\fR] [\fI-n\fR] [\fI-scd\fR] [\fI-sd\fR]
[\fI-sr\fR] [\fI-st\fR] [\fI-V\fR] [\fI-x\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sometimes it is difficult to determine which SCSI device a sg device
name (e.g. /dev/sg0) refers to. This command loops through the
sg devices and finds the corresponding SCSI disk, cdrom or tape
device name (if any). Scanners are an example of SCSI devices
that have no alternate SCSI device name apart from their sg device
name.
.TP
-a
assume the sg devices have alphabetical device names and loop
through /dev/sga, /dev/sgb, etc. Default is numeric scan
.TP
-h
print usage message then exit.
.TP
-i
in addition do a standard INQUIRY and output vendor, product and revision
strings for devices that are found.
.TP
-n
assume the sg devices have numeric device names and loop
through /dev/sg0, /dev/sg1, etc. Default is numeric scan
.TP
-sd
display mappings to SCSI disk device names
.TP
-scd
display mappings to SCSI cdrom device names of the form
/dev/scd0, /dev/scd1 etc
.TP
-sr
display mappings to SCSI cdrom device names of the form
/dev/sr0, /dev/sr1 etc
.TP
-st
display mappings to SCSI tape device names
.TP
-V
print out version string then exit (without further ado).
.TP
-x
after each active sg device name is displayed there are
five digits: <host_number> <bus> <scsi_id> <lun> <scsi_type>
.PP
If no options starting with "-s" are given then the mapping to
all SCSI disk, cdrom and tape device names is shown.
.PP
If the device file system (devfs) is present a line noting
this is output. The "native" devfs scsi hierarchy makes the
relationship between a sg device name and any corresponding
disk, cdrom or tape device name easy to establish. This
replaces the need for this command. However many applications
will continue to look for Linux SCSI device names in their
traditional places. [Devfs supplies a compatibility daemon
called devfsd whose default configuration adds back the
Linux device names in their traditional positions.
.PP
Quite often the mapping information can be derived by
observing the output of the command: "cat /proc/scsi/scsi".
However if devices have been added since boot this can
be deceptive.
.PP
In the linux kernel 2.6 series something close to the mapping
shown by this utility can be found by analysing sysfs. The
main difference is that sysfs analysis will show the mapping
between sg nodes and other SCSI device nodes in terms of
major and minor numbers. While major 8, minor 16 will usually
be /dev/sdb this is not necessarily so. Facilities associated
with udev may assign major 8, minor 16 some other device node
name. This version of sg_map has been extended to cope with
sparse disk device node names of the form "/dev/sd<str>"
where <str> can be one of [a-z,aa-zz,aaa-zzz].
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
My system has a SCSI disk, a cd writer and a dvd player:
.br
   $ sg_map
.br
   # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present
.br
   /dev/sg0  /dev/sda
.br
   /dev/sg1  /dev/sr0
.br
   /dev/sg2  /dev/sr1
.PP
In order to find which sg device name corresponds to the disk:
.br
   $ sg_map -sd
.br
   # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present
.br
   /dev/sg0  /dev/sda
.br
   /dev/sg1
.br
   /dev/sg2
.PP
The "-x" option gives the following output:
.br
   sg_map -x
.br
   # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present
.br
   /dev/sg0  1 0 1 0  0  /dev/sda
.br
   /dev/sg1  2 0 4 0  5  /dev/sr0
.br
   /dev/sg2  2 0 6 0  5  /dev/sr1
.PP
When a SCSI scanner is added the output becomes:
.br
   $ sg_map
.br
   # Note: the devfs pseudo file system is present
.br
   /dev/sg0  /dev/sda
.br
   /dev/sg1  /dev/sr0
.br
   /dev/sg2  /dev/sr1
.br
   /dev/sg3
.PP
By process of elimination /dev/sg3 must be the scanner.
