.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send a READ MEDIA SERIAL NUMBER SCSI command to the given device and
outputs the response. 
.PP
This command is described in SPC-3 found at www.t10.org . It was
originally added to SPC-3 in revision 11 (2003/2/12). It is not an
mandatory command and the author has not seen any SCSI devices
that support it.
.TP
--help | -h
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
--raw | -r
sends the serial number (if found) to stdout. This output may contain
non-printable characters (e.g. the serial number is padded with NULLs
at the end so its length is a multiple of 4). The default action is
to print the serial number out in ASCII-HEX with ASCII characters to
the right. All error messages are sent to stderr.
.TP
--verbose | -v
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
--version | -V
print the version string and then exit.
.PP
Device identification information is also found in a standard INQUIRY
response and its VPD pages (see sg_vpd). The relevant VPD pages are
the "device identification page" (VPD page 0x83) and the "unit serial
number" page (VPD page 0x80).
.PP
The MMC-4 command set for CDs and DVDs has a "media serial number"
feature (0x109) [and a "logical unit serial number" feature]. These
can be viewed with sg_get_config.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_rmsn is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
