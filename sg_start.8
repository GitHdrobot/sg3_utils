.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
sg_start sends a START STOP UNIT SCSI command to the given device with
the selected options. The most used options are "-stop" to spin down a disk
and "-start" to spin up a disk. Using "sg_start -start /dev/sda" on a disk
that is already spinning is harmless. There is also finer grain control
with "power conditions": active, idle and standby. In some contexts
the "stop" state can be considered an additional power condition. 
.PP
Devices that contain removable media such as cd/dvds can use the '-loej'
flag to load the media when used in conjunction with "-start" (i.e. load
media then spin up). Alternatively '-loej' may be used to eject the media
when used alone or when used in conjunction with "-stop" (i.e. spin down
then eject media).
.TP
0
stop (spin-down) given device.
Active when '-pc=" is not given or '-pc=0'.
.TP
1
start (spin-up) given device.
Active when '-pc=" is not given or '-pc=0'. Harmless if device has
already started (or is in the process of starting).
.TP
-imm=0|1
when the immediate bit is 1 (default) then this command (and hence this
utility) return immediately after the device has received the command.
When this option is 0 then the command returns when the action it
requests has been completed.
.TP
-loej
load the media when the unit is started or eject it when the unit is
stopped. This option is ignored if 'pc > 0'. Default is off (i.e. don't
attempt to load or eject media). If a start/start indication is not
given (neither "-start" nor "-stop") and this option is given then a
stop and eject action is assumed.
.TP
-pc=<n>
set the 'power conditions' value (in hex); 0 to f (inclusive) are valid.
Default value is 0.
When '-pc=0' then '-start', '-stop' and '-loej' are active.
Some common values are 1 for the active power condition; 2 for the idle
power condition; 3 for the standby power condition, 7 for LU_CONTROL,
a (hex == decimal 10) for FORCE_IDLE_0 and b (hex) for FORCE_STANDBY_0.
See recent SBC-2 or SAS drafts at www.t10.org for more information.
.TP
-start
start (spin-up) given device. Same meaning as "1" argument.
.TP
-stop
stop (spin-down) given device. Same meaning as "0" argument.
.TP
-v
verbose: outputs SCSI command in hex to console before with executing
it. '-vv' and '-vvv' are also accepted yielding greater verbosity.
.TP
-V
print out version string then exit.
.PP
Only one of "0", "1", "-start" and "-stop" is accepted to avoid confusion.
.PP
There is an associated "power condition" mode page (0x1a) in which timer
values can be set for transitioning to either idle or standby state after
a period of inactivity. The sdparm utility can be used to view the
power condition mode page and the sginfo utility can view and change it.
If a device is in either idle or standby power condition state then
a REQUEST SENSE command (see the sg_requests utility) should yield 
a sense key of "no sense" and an additional sense code of "Low
power condition on".
.PP
Ejection of removable media (e.g. 'sg_start 0 -loej /dev/hdd' where
the device is an ATAPI cd/dvd drive) may be prevented by a prior
PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL SCSI command (see sg_prevent). In this
case this utility should fail with an error generated by the device:
illegal request / medium removal prevented.
.PP
In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the given device must be
a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. disks
and SCSI DVDs) can also be specified. For example "sg_start 0 /dev/sda"
will work in the 2.6 series kernels.
.SH NOTE
Earlier versions had a '-s' option to perform a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command
before the START STOP UNIT command was issued. According to recent SBC-2
drafts this is done implicitly if required. Hence the "-s" option has been
dropped.
