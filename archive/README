This archive directory contains programs the use the Linux SCSI
subsystem and typically use the SCSI generic interface (sg) as
well.

The programs in this directory are fully functional but have been
"retired" from the main sg_utils directory most likely because
their functionality is done in another (perhaps better) way.

The last time I checked these programs compiled and built and
didn't depend on too many other things (see the Makefile in the
parent directory for ideas).
