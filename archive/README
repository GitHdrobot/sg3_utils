In order to save source code space, the files is this directory have
been removed (apart from the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script). See the
sg3_utils-1.22 source tarball for the most recent version that
included this source.

The primary site for rescan-scsi-bus.sh is http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux
under the "Rescan SCSI bus" heading. Updated to rescan-scsi-bus.sh
version 1.56 (2012-01-15) in sg3_utils version 1.35 .
