The contents of this "pre_configure" subdirectory are the hand-crafted
Makefiles and associated scripts that were used prior to their replacment
by the autotools based logic. The autotools suite is associated with the
build sequence: "./configure ; make ; make install" that many users are
coming to expect. While it might be easier for users (especially on
lesser used architectures) autotools is a pain to setup. It can also
be sensitive to which versions of build tools (e.g. autoconf and automake)
are being used.

Hence the old hand-crafted Makefiles and associated scripts are archived
in this directory. They represent the state of the build system during
the development of sg3_utils version 1.25 . This older build system
won't be maintained past this point and is put here for reference and
may be helpful if autotools breaks down (or at least they may show the
author's intentions).

Note that various other subdirectories (e.g. utils and examples) still
use hand-crafted Makefiles.
