.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send WRITE LONG command to a Linux SCSI device. The
buffer to be written to the device is filled with byte
.B 0xff
or read from the given file. This buffer includes the sector data and
the ECC bytes.
.PP
This utility can be used generate a MEDIUM ERROR at a specific logical
block address. This can be useful for testing. Prior to testing, the
.B sg_dd
utility could be used to copy the original contents of the logical
block address to some safe location. After testing the
.B sg_dd
utility could be used to write back the original contents of the
logical block address. An alternate strategy would be to read the "long"
contents of the logical block address with
.B sg_read_long
utility prior to testing and restore it with this utility after testing.
.TP
--help | -h
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
--in=<name> | -i <name>
read data (binary) from given file <name> and use it for the WRITE LONG
SCSI command. If <name> is "-" then stdin is read. If this option is
not given then a buffer of 0xff bytes is written.
.TP
--lba=<num> | -l <num>
the logical block address of the sector to corrupt. Defaults to lba 0
which is a dangerous block to overwrite on a disk that is in use.
Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with '0x'. Only 32 bit
lbas currently supported.
.TP
--verbose | -v
increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).
.TP
--version | -V
output version string then exit.
.TP
--xfer_len=<num>|-x <num>
the transfer length in bytes (default to 520). If the given value (or the
default) does not match the "long" block size of the device, nothing is
written to the device and the appropriate xfer_len value is derived from the
error response and printed (to stderr).
.PP
The lba and xfer_len numerical arguments may be followed by the following
multiplicative suffixes:
c C *1; b B *512; k *1,024; K *1,000; m *1,048,576; M *1,000,000;
g *1,073,741,824; and G *1,000,000,000
.PP
Alternatively numerical values can be given in hexadecimal preceded by
either "0x" or "0X". When hex numbers are given multipliers cannot be
used.
.SH "NOTES"
To read from a defective sector (that, for example, has been filled with
0xff bytes by this utility) use:
.PP
  sg_dd if=<scsi_device> skip=<lba> of=/dev/null bs=512 count=1
.PP
To overwrite to a defective sector use:
.PP
  sg_dd of=<scsi_device> seek=<lba> if=/dev/zero bs=512 count=1    
.PP
This will result in a sector (block) with 512 bytes of 0x0 without a
MEDIUM ERROR since the ECC and associated data will be well formed.
.PP
The 10 byte WRITE LONG SCSI command is implemented (not the 16
byte variant). This limits the logical block address to a 32 bit
quantity.
