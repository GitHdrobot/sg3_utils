.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send REPORT LUNS command to a SCSI device and output the response.
In the SPC-3 SCSI standard support for this command is mandatory.
.TP
--decode | -d
decode logical unit numbers into their hierarchical parts. Interprets
luns as described in SAM-3 when the HiSup bit is set in a
standard INQUIRY's response.
.TP
--help | -h
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
--hex | -H
output response to this command in ASCII hex.
.TP
--raw | -r

.TP
--select=<n> | -s <n>
this option sets the 'select report' field in the SCSI REPORT LUNS command.
The default value is 0. When 0 is given (or this option is not specified)
then the given device should yield a list of luns addressable via
this "I_T nexus" that use the following lun addressing methods: logical
unit addressing, peripheral device addressing and flat space addressing.
When 1 is given the given device should yield a list of only "well known"
logical units addressable via this "I_T" nexus. When 2 is given the given
device should yield all luns addressable via this "I_T" nexus. Currently
SPC-3 (rev 21) doesn't specify any other values. 
.TP
--verbose | -v
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
--version | -V
print the version string and then exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_luns is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
