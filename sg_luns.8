.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send the SCSI REPORT LUNS command to the \fIDEVICE\fR and outputs the
response. In the SPC\-3 SCSI standard support for this command is mandatory.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-decode\fR
decode logical unit numbers into their hierarchical parts. Interprets
luns as described in SAM\-3 when the HiSup bit is set in a
standard INQUIRY's response.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output response to this command in ASCII hex.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output response in binary (to stdout).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR=\fISR\fR
this option sets the 'select report' field (\fISR\fR) in the SCSI REPORT
LUNS command. The default value is 0. When 0 is given (or this option is
not specified) then the \fIDEVICE\fR should yield a list of luns addressable
via this "I_T nexus" that use the following lun addressing methods: logical
unit addressing, peripheral device addressing and flat space addressing.
When 1 is given the \fIDEVICE\fR should yield a list of only "well known"
logical units addressable via this "I_T" nexus. When 2 is given the
\fIDEVICE\fR should yield all luns addressable via this "I_T" nexus.
Currently SPC\-3 (rev 23) doesn't specify any other values. 
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_luns is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
