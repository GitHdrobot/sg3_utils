.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
This utility sends one or more SCSI TEST UNIT READY commands to the
\fIDEVICE\fR. This may be useful for timing the per command overhead.
Note that TEST UNIT READY has no associated data, just a 6 byte command
and a returned SCSI status value. If the SCSI status value is CHECK
CONDITION then most modern initiators fetch sense data from
the device (i.e. autosense).
.PP
This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the preferred one is
shown first in the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section
on the old command line syntax outlines the second group of options.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print out the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-number\fR=\fINUM\fR
performs TEST UNIT READY \fINUM\fR times. If not given defaults to 1.
These suffix multipliers are permitted: c C *1; w W *2; b B *512;
k K KiB *1,024; KB *1,000; m M MiB *1,048,576; MB *1,000,000;
g G GiB *1,073,741,824; and GB *1,000,000,000 . Also a suffix of the
form "x<n>" multiplies the leading number by <n>. Alternatively a hex
number may be given, prefixed by either '0x' or has a trailing 'h'.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-old\fR
switch to older style options.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-progress\fR
show progress indication (a percentage) if available.  If \fI\-\-number=NUM\fR
is given and \fINUM\fR is greater than 1 then waits 30 seconds before
subsequent checks. Exits when \fINUM\fR is reached or there is no more
progress indication. Ignores \fI\-\-time\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR
after completing the requested number of TEST UNIT READY commands, outputs
the total duration and the average number of commands executed per second.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase level or verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version string then exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_turs is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
.SH OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
The options in this section were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils
version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options can
be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable
or using '\-\-old' (or '\-O) as the first option.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR=\fINUM\fR
performs TEST UNIT READY \fINUM\fR times. If not given defaults to 1.
Equivalent to \fI\-\-number=NUM\fR in the main description.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR
switch to the newer style options.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
show progress indication (a percentage) if available.
Equivalent to \fI\-\-progress\fR in the main description.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
after completing the requested number of TEST UNIT READY commands, outputs
the total duration and the average number of commands executed per second.
Equivalent to \fI\-\-time\fR in the main description.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
increase level of verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
print out version string then exit.
