.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send controls to a SES device (via a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command)
or fetches status (via a SCSI RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command).
The \fIDEVICE\fR should be a SES device which may be a dedicated
enclosure services processor (INQUIRY peripheral device type 0xd) or
attached to another type of SCSI device (e.g. a disk) in which case
the EncServ bit set in its INQUIRY response.
.PP
If no options are given (only the \fIDEVICE\fR argument) then all
diagnostic pages supported by the device (including SES pages)
are listed.
.PP
The most recent reference for this utility is the draft SCSI Enclosure
Services 3 document T10/2149\-D Revision 2 at http://ww.t10.org . Existing
standards for SES and SES\-2 are ANSI INCITS 305\-1998 and ANSI INCITS
448\-2008 respectively.
.PP
A tutorial on SES can be found here:
http://www.snia.org/events/storage\-developer2008/presentations/monday/RajendraDivecha_SCSI_SES.pdf .
It contains both an overview and in depth information suitable for decoding
the contents of some diagnostic pages used by SES.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
The options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-byte1\fR=\fIB1\fR
some control pages need byte 1 (i.e. the second byte) of the cdb set.
Only required in rare cases when the \fI\-\-control\fR option is also set.
Default is 0; \fIB1\fR is in decimal unless it is prefixed by '0x'
or '0X' (or has a trailing 'h' or 'H').
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-control\fR
will send control information to the \fIDEVICE\fR via a SCSI SEND
DIAGNOSTIC command. Cannot give both this option and \fI\-\-status\fR.
The Enclosure control, String Out, Threshold Out, Array control (obsolete
in SES\-2) and Subenclosure String Out diagnostic pages can be set currently.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-data\fR=\fIH,H...\fR
permits a string of comma separated (ASCII) hex bytes to be specified (limit
1024). A (single) space separated string of hex bytes is also allowed but
the list needs to be in quotes. This allows the parameters to a control
diagnostic page to be specified. The string given should not include the
first 4 bytes (i.e. page code and length). See next entry for using stdin.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-data\fR=\-
reads a data string from stdin, limit 1024 bytes. Spaces, tabs and line feeds
additionally are permitted as separators.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR
cuts down on the amount of output from the enclosure status diagnostic
page. When this option is given, any line which has all its binary flags
cleared (i.e. 0) is filtered out (i.e. ignored). If a line has some other
value on it (e.g. a temperature) then it is output.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inner\-hex\fR
the outer levels of a status diagnostic page are decoded and printed out
but the innermost level (e.g. the element status descriptor) is output in
hex. Implemented for the more complex diagnostic pages.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fIIND\fR
where \fIIND\fR is either an element index or an overall index (both are
origin 0). If \fIIND\fR is between 0 and 999 then it refers to a non\-overall
element. If \fIIND\fR is between 1000 and 1999, or starts with the
string 'ov' followed by 0 to 999, then it refers to an overall element. With
this option 1 element will be output if an index match is found, otherwise no
element is output. The default action (i.e. without this option) is to list
all elements. Useful with the enclosure status, element descriptor, threshold
in and additional element status pages, plus with the \fI\-\-join\fR option.
See the INDEXES section below.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-join\fR
group elements from the element descriptor, enclosure status and additional
element status pages. If this option is given twice then elements from
the threshold in page are also grouped. The order is dictated by the
configuration page. All elements are output unless the \fI\-\-index=IND\fR
option is given, in which case only the matching element is output, or
no element is output if there is no match. See the INDEXES section below.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
list all known diagnostic page names and SES elements. \fIDEVICE\fR
is ignored and utility exits.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-page\fR=\fIPG\fR
where \fIPG\fR is a page code. Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed by
0x for hex. Valid range is 0 to 255 (0x0 to 0xff) inclusive. Default is
page_code 0 (i.e. "Supported diagnostic pages").
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
outputs the chosen status page in (ASCII) hex in a format suitable for
a later invocation using the \fI\-\-data=\fR option. A status diagnostic
page less its first 4 bytes (page code and length) is output.
When used twice (e.g. \fI\-rr\fR) outputs full diagnostic page in binary
to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR
will fetch status diagnostic page from the \fIDEVICE\fR via a SCSI RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. If this option is not given and
\fI\-\-control\fR is not given then \fI\-\-status\fR is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH INDEXES
An enclosure can have information about its disk and tape drives plus
other supporting components like power supplies spread across several
diagnostic pages. Keeping this information "in sync" is relatively
complicated.
.PP
The Configuration page is key: it contains a list of "type headers",
each of which contains an element type (e.g. array element), a
sub\-enclosure identifier (0 for the main enclosure) and a number of
possible elements. Corresponding to each type header, the enclosure
status page has one "overall" element plus "number of possible
elements" elements and all those elements are of the given element type.
For many element types the "number of possible elements" will be 0 so
the enclosure status page has one "overall" element corresponding
to that type header. The element descriptor page and the threshold (in)
page follow the same pattern as the enclosure status page.
.PP
The additional element status page is a bit more complicated. It has
entries for "number of possible elements" of certain element types. It
does not have entries corresponding to the "overall" elements. To make
the correspondence a little clearer each descriptor in this page optionally
contains an "Element Index Present" indicator. And that element index
refers to the order that elements appear in the status enclosure page (and
friends) starting at 0 and excluding all overall elements.
.PP
To fit in with this pattern the \fI\-\-index=IND\fR option refers to one
of two indexing schemes. The first is for all elements, excluding overall
elements, starting at 0 and in the order they appear in the enclosure status
page. The second indexing scheme is for overall elements only, starting at
0. If \fIIND\fR is a value between 0 and 999 then it refers to the
non\-overall elements. If \fIIND\fR is a value between 1000 and 1999, or
starts with the string 'ov' followed by 0 to 999, then it refers to the
overall elements.
.SH NOTES
This utility can be used to fetch arbitrary (i.e. non SES) diagnostic
pages (using the SCSI READ DIAGNOSTIC command). To this end the
\fI\-\-page=PG\fR and \fI\-\-hex\fR options would be appropriate. Arbitrary
diagnostic pages can be sent to a device with the sg_senddiag utility.
.PP
There is a related command set called SAF\-TE (SCSI attached fault\-tolerant
enclosure) for enclosure (including RAID) status and control. SCSI devices
that support SAF\-TE report "Processor" peripheral device type (0x3) in their
INQUIRY response. See the sg_safte utility in this package or safte\-monitor
on the internet.
.SH EXAMPLES
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in
other supported Operating Systems see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
.PP
To view the supported pages:
.PP
   sg_ses /dev/sda
.PP
To view the configuration page:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=1 /dev/sda
.PP
To view the status page:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=2 /dev/sda
.PP
Changing a temperature threshold is possible, if a little awkward. The
current thresholds can be shown with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=5 /dev/sda
.PP
The threshold to be changed can be chosen. Then output the threshold page
in hex (suitable for editing) with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=5 \-\-raw /dev/sda > t
.PP
Then with the aid of the SES\-2 document (in revision 9: section 6.1.8)
use your favourite editor to change t. The change can be sent to the
device with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-control \-\-page=5 \-\-data=\- /dev/sda < t
.PP
If the above is successful, the threshold should have been changed. To
check try:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=5 /dev/sda
.PP
again.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_ses is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
