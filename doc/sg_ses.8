.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Fetches status from a SCSI Enclosure Service (SES) device (via a SCSI RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command). This utility can also send controls to a SES
device (via a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command). The \fIDEVICE\fR should be a SES
device which may be a dedicated enclosure services processor (INQUIRY
peripheral device type 0xd) or attached to another type of SCSI device (e.g.
a disk) in which case the EncServ bit is set in its INQUIRY response.
.PP
If no options are given (only the \fIDEVICE\fR argument) then all diagnostic
pages supported by the device (including SES pages) are listed.
.PP
Changing the state of an enclosure (e.g. requesting the "ident" (locate) LED
to flash on a disk carrier in an array) is typically done using a
read\-modify\-write cycle. See the section on CHANGING STATE below.
.PP
The most recent reference for this utility is the draft SCSI Enclosure
Services 3 document T10/2149\-D Revision 3 at http://www.t10.org . Existing
standards for SES and SES\-2 are ANSI INCITS 305\-1998 and ANSI INCITS
448\-2008 respectively.
.PP
A tutorial on SES can be found here:
http://www.snia.org/events/storage\-developer2008/presentations/monday/RajendraDivecha_SCSI_SES.pdf .
It contains both an overview and in depth information suitable for decoding
the contents of some diagnostic pages used by SES.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
The options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-byte1\fR=\fIB1\fR
some control pages need byte 1 (i.e. the second byte) set. In the enclosure
control diagnostic page byte 1 contains the INFO, NON\-CRIT, CRIT and UNRECOV
bits. If \fI\-\-control\fR and \fI\-\-data=H,H...\fR options are used then
the default value is 0. If the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR or
\fI\-\-set=STR\fR option is used the default value is what was in byte 1
when the status page was read. \fIB1\fR is in decimal unless it is prefixed
by '0x' or '0X' (or has a trailing 'h' or 'H').
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-control\fR
will send control information to the \fIDEVICE\fR via a SCSI SEND
DIAGNOSTIC command. Cannot give both this option and \fI\-\-status\fR.
The Enclosure control, String Out, Threshold Out, Array control (obsolete
in SES\-2) and Subenclosure String Out diagnostic pages can be set currently.
Not needed with the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR and \fI\-\-set=STR\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR=\fISTR\fR
Used to clear a field in a control element. Must be used together with
a \fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR or \fI\-\-index=...\fR option to specify which
element is to be changed. By default the enclosure control page is modified,
the only other page that can be modified is the threshold out page. See the
STR FORMAT section below. 
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-data\fR=\fIH,H...\fR
permits a string of comma separated (ASCII) hex bytes to be specified (limit
1024). A (single) space separated string of hex bytes is also allowed but
the list needs to be in quotes. This allows the parameters to a control
diagnostic page to be specified. The string given should not include the
first 4 bytes (i.e. page code and length). See next entry for using stdin.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-data\fR=\-
reads a data string from stdin, limit 1024 bytes. Spaces, tabs and line feeds
additionally are permitted as separators.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-descriptor\fR=\fIDN\fR
where \fIDN\fR is a descriptor name (string) as found in the element
descriptor diagnostic page (i.e. page 7). If that page is supported then
\fIDN\fR may be alternative for \fIOIE,II\fR (in the \fI\-\-index=OIE,II\fR
option). If the descriptor name contains a space then \fIDN\fR needs to be
surrounded by quotes (single or double) or the space escaped (e.g. preceded
by a backslash). Some elements (e.g. overall elements) may not have
descriptor names. Useful with the \fI\-\-join\fR option as well as the
\fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR and \fI\-\-set=STR\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR
cuts down on the amount of output from the enclosure status diagnostic
page and the additional element status page. When this option is given, any
line which has all its binary flags cleared (i.e. 0) is filtered out (i.e.
ignored). If a line has some other value on it (e.g. a temperature) then
it is output.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-get\fR=\fISTR\fR
Used to read a field in a status element. Must be used together with
a \fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR or \fI\-\-index=...\fR option to specify which
element is to be read. By default the enclosure status page is read, the
only other pages that can be read are the threshold in and additional
element status pages. If a value is found it is output in decimal to
stdout (by default) or in hexidecimal prededed by "0x" if the \fI\-\-hex\fR
option is given. See the STR FORMAT section below. 
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
If the \fI\-\-get=STR\fR option is given then output the value found (if
any) in hexadecimal, with a leading "0x". Otherwise output the response
in hexadecimal. Ignored with some options (e.g. \fI\-\-join\fR).
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inner\-hex\fR
the outer levels of a status diagnostic page are decoded and printed out
but the innermost level (e.g. the element status descriptor) is output in
hex. Implemented for the more complex diagnostic pages.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fIIIE\fR
where \fIIIE\fR is either an individual index or an element type abbreviation.
See the INDEXES section below. To list the available element type
abbreviations use the \fI\-\-list\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-index\fR=\fIOIE,II\fR
where \fIOIE,II\fR is an overall index (or element type abbreviation)
followed by an individual index. See the INDEXES section below. To list the
available element type abbreviations use the \fI\-\-list\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-join\fR
group elements from the element descriptor, enclosure status and additional
element status pages. If this option is given twice then elements from
the threshold in page are also grouped. The order is dictated by the
configuration page. All elements are output unless the \fI\-\-index=IND\fR
option is given, in which case only the matching element is output, or
no element is output if there is no match. See the INDEXES section below.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
list all known diagnostic page names and SES elements when \fI\-\-list\fR
is given once. If \fI\-\-list\fR is given twice, then the recognized acronyms
for the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR and \fI\-\-set=STR\fR options
are listed. The utility exits after listing this information (so most
other options and \fIDEVICE\fR are ignored).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-page\fR=\fIPG\fR
where \fIPG\fR is a page code. Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed by
0x for hex. Valid range is 0 to 255 (0x0 to 0xff) inclusive. Default is
page_code 0 (i.e. "Supported diagnostic pages").
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
outputs the chosen status page in (ASCII) hex in a format suitable for
a later invocation using the \fI\-\-data=\fR option. A status diagnostic
page less its first 4 bytes (page code and length) is output.
When used twice (e.g. \fI\-rr\fR) outputs full diagnostic page in binary
to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR
will fetch status diagnostic page from the \fIDEVICE\fR via a SCSI RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. If this option is not given and
\fI\-\-control\fR is not given then \fI\-\-status\fR is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-set\fR=\fISTR\fR
Used to set a field in a control element. Must be used together with
a \fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR or \fI\-\-index=...\fR option to specify which
element is to be changed. By default the enclosure control page is modified,
the only other page that can be modified is the threshold out page. See the
STR FORMAT section below. 
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH INDEXES
An enclosure can have information about its disk and tape drives plus
other supporting components like power supplies spread across several
diagnostic pages. Addressing a specific element (overall or individual)
is complicated.
.PP
The Configuration page is key: it contains a list of "type headers",
each of which contains an element type (e.g. array device slot), a
sub\-enclosure identifier (0 for the main enclosure) and a number of
possible elements. Corresponding to each type header, the enclosure
status page has one "overall" element plus "number of possible
elements" individual elements all of which have the given element type.
For some element types the "number of possible elements" will be 0 so
the enclosure status page has only one "overall" element corresponding
to that type header. The element descriptor page and the threshold (in
and out) page follow the same pattern as the enclosure status page.
.PP
The additional element status page is a bit more complicated. It has
entries for "number of possible elements" of certain element types. It
does not have entries corresponding to the "overall" elements. To make
the correspondence a little clearer each descriptor in this page optionally
contains an "Element Index Present" indicator. If so that element index
refers to the order that elements appear in the status enclosure page (and
friends) starting at 0 for each element type and excluding all overall
elements.
.PP
Addressing a single overall element or a single individual element is
done with two indexes: OI and II. Both are origin 0. OI=0 corresponds to
the first type header entry which must be a device slot or array device
slot element type (according to the SES\-2 standard). To address the
corresponding overall instance, II is set to -1, otherwise II can be
set to the individual instance index. As an alternative to the overall
index (OI), an element type abbreviation (e.g. "ps") optionally followed
by a number (e.g. "ps1" refers to the second power supply element type)
can be given.
.PP
One of two command lines variants can be used to specify indexes:
\fI\-\-index=OIE,II\fR where \fIOIE\fR is either an overall index (OI) or
an element type abbreviation (e.g. "ps" or "ps1"). \fIII\fR is the sub\-index
and is either an individual index or "-1" to specify the overall element.
The second variant is \fI\-\-index=IIE\fR where \fIIIE\fR is either an
individual index (II) that is equivalent to \fI\-\-index=0,II\fR or an
element type abbreviation that is equivalent to \fI\-\-index=E,-1\fR.
.PP
For example if the first type header in the Configuration page has array
device slot element type then \fI\-\-index=0,-1\fR is equivalent to
\fI\-\-index=arr\fR. Also \fI\-\-index=arr,3\fR is equivalent to
\fI\-\-index=3\fR. In the latter case if the "number of possible elements"
is less than 4 then nothing is addressed.
.PP
Note that if the element descriptor page is available then the 
\fI\-\-descriptor=DN\fR option may be an alternative to the
\fI\-\-index=...\fR option.
.SH STR FORMAT
The \fISTR\fR arguments of the \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR, \fI\-\-get=STR\fR and
\fI\-\-set=STR\fR options all have the same structure. There are two forms:
.br
      <acronym>[=<value>]
.br
      <start_byte>:<start_bit>[:<num_bits>][=<value>]
.PP
The <acronym> is one of a list of common fields (e.g. "ident" and "fault")
that the utilty converts internally into the second form. The <start_byte>
is usually in the range 0 to 3, the <start_bit> must be in the range 0 to
7 and the <num_bits> must be in the range 1 to 64 (default 1). The
number of bits are read in the left to right sense of the element tables
shown in the various SES draft documents. For example the 8 bits of
byte 2 would be represented as 2:7:8 with the most significant bit being
2:7 and the LSB being 2:0 .
.PP
The <value> is optional but is ignored if provided to \fI\-\-get=STR\fR.
For \fI\-\-set=STR\fR the default <value> is 1 while for \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR
the default value is 0 .
.PP
The supported list of <acronym>s can be viewed by using the \fI\-\-list\fR
option twice (or "\-ll").
.SH CHANGING STATE
This utility has various techniques for changing the state of a SES device.
As noted above this is typically a read\-modify\-write type operation.
Most modifiable pages have a "status" (or "in") page that can be read, and
a corresponding "control" (or "out") page that can be written back to change
the state of the enclosure.
.PP
The lowest level technique provided by this utility involves outputting
a "status" page in hex with \fI\-\-raw\fR. Then a text editor can be used
to edit the hex (note: to change an enclosure control descriptor the SELECT
bit needs to be set). Next the control page data can fed back with the
\fI\-\-data=H,H...\fR option together with the \fI\-\-control\fR option;
the \fI\-\-byte1=B1\fR option may need to be given as well.
.PP
Changes to the enclosure control page (and the threshold out page) can be
done at a higher level. This involves choosing a page (the default in this
case is the enclosure control page). Next choose an individual or overall
element index (or name it with its element descriptor string). Then give
the element's name (e.g. "ident" for RQST IDENT) or its position within that
element (e.g. in an array device slot control element RQST IDENT is byte 2,
bit 1 and 1 bit long ("2:1:1")). Finally a value can be given, if not the
value for \fI\-\-set=STR\fR defaults to 1 and for \fI\-\-clear=STR\fR
defaults to 0.
.SH NOTES
This utility can be used to fetch arbitrary (i.e. non SES) diagnostic
pages (using the SCSI READ DIAGNOSTIC command). To this end the
\fI\-\-page=PG\fR and \fI\-\-hex\fR options would be appropriate. Arbitrary
diagnostic pages can be sent to a device with the sg_senddiag utility.
.PP
The most troublesome part of the join operation is associating Additional
Element Status descriptors correctly. At least one SES device vendor has
misinterpreted the SES\-2 standard with its "element index" field. The
code in this utility interprets the "element index" field per the SES\-2
standard and if that yields an inappropriate element type, adjusts its
indexing to follow that vendor's misinterpretation. 
.PP
There is a related command set called SAF\-TE (SCSI attached fault\-tolerant
enclosure) for enclosure (including RAID) status and control. SCSI devices
that support SAF\-TE report "Processor" peripheral device type (0x3) in their
INQUIRY response. See the sg_safte utility in this package or safte\-monitor
on the internet.
.SH EXAMPLES
These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in
other supported Operating Systems see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
.PP
To view the supported pages:
.PP
   sg_ses /dev/sda
.PP
To view the configuration page:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=1 /dev/sda
.PP
To view the status page:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=2 /dev/sda
.PP
Changing a temperature threshold is possible, if a little awkward. The
current thresholds can be shown with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=5 /dev/sda
.PP
The threshold to be changed can be chosen. Then output the threshold page
in hex (suitable for editing) with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=5 \-\-raw /dev/sda > t
.PP
Then with the aid of the SES\-3 document (in revision 3: section 6.1.8)
use your favourite editor to change t. The changes can be sent to the
device with:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-control \-\-page=5 \-\-data=\- /dev/sda < t
.PP
If the above is successful, the threshold should have been changed. To
check try:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-page=5 /dev/sda
.PP
again.
.PP
Fields in the various elements of the enclosure control diagnostic page
can be changed with a higher level syntax. The following example looks
at flashing the "ident" LED (also called "locate") on "ArrayDevice07"
which is a disk (or more precisely the carrier drawer the disk is in):
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-index=7 \-\-set=2:1:1 /dev/sg3
.PP
If the element descriptor diagnostic page shows that "ArrayDevice07" is
the descriptor name associated with element index 7 then this invocation
is equivalent to the last one:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-descriptor=ArrayDevice07 \-\-set=2:1:1 /dev/sg3
.PP
Further the byte 2, bit 1 (for 1 bit) field in the array slot control
element is RQST INDENT for asking a disk carrier to flash a LED so it can
be located. In this case "ident" (or "locate") is accepted as an acronym
for that field:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-descriptor=ArrayDevice07 \-\-set=ident /dev/sg3
.PP
To turn off that LED:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-descriptor=ArrayDevice07 \-\-clear=ident /dev/sg3
.PP
To get the SAS address of that device (which is held in the additional
element sense page (page 10)) printed on hex:
.PP
   sg_ses \-p 10 \-D ArrayDevice07 \-G at_sas_addr \-H /dev/sg3
.PP
To collate the information in the enclosure status, element descriptor
and additional element status pages the \fI\-\-join\fR option can be used:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-join /dev/sg3
.PP
This will produce a lot of output. To filter out lines that don't contain
much information add the \fI\-\-filter\fR option:
.PP
   sg_ses \-\-join \-\-filter /dev/sg3
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_ses is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
